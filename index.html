        <a id="section-1"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
        
        <p>The Terluzvan union is a nation based in a fictious society. <br>
        located in south America, the same society is part of a fictious universe
        named <strong>"hexanthus"</strong> wich means '16 golden things'. A micronation is a small nation
        without recognition or real autonomy, thus Terluzva neither is recognized by any country
        wich is a ONU member nor it enjoys autonomy from a South American government, it is only a
        a national-entity, or rather a micronation, with is own micro culture and micro-organization.</p>
        <p>The Terluzvan society, is supossed to be a utopic an over-modernized society in
        a united South America under a unique regime, however, its government structure
        and culture are very different from what we exprience in our everyday lives in real world; to sumarize,
        if we believe in a omnipotent God they do not believe in any traditional god,
        if we speak our actual languages they have another very different language, if we live under presitenial
        states, they live in neo-monarchists states.
        </p>
        <a id="section-2"><h2>Representative symbols</h2></a>
        
        <h3>The <strong>main</strong> blag</h3>
        <img src="intro_images/TerluzvaFlag1.jpg" alt="blue and yellow flag with a rhombus with two moons">
        <p>The first flag is the official flag of our nation, the flag represent the origin of our country
        through the <em>rhombus</em> wich means the island where come the ancerters of our nation named 
        'Aurora Islands', also represent the intelligence with the blue color and the resilicience with the
        yellow color, there are two circles wich are the Sirius star reflected by the ocean. The Sirius 
        star also appear in another symbol.
        </p>
        <a id="section-3"><h3>The <strong>Sirius star</strong></h3></a>
        
        <img src="intro_images/TerluzvaFlag2.jpg">
        <p>The Sirius Star help the ancesters to travel through a long path from Oceania to The Americas
        and therefore the nation is not alone there are more nations from the same ancesters, those nations
        are <b>lost</b> for now.
        </p>

        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>The people in Terluzva micronation dont speak any know language because they have their own
        language named padot, which means "Language of thoughts", this language is try to unify all
        Terluzvan nations.<br>
        Anexinism is the religion of the pre-Terluzvan nations and Terluzva current entity, the religion
        don't have any god, there is a omnipotent entity know as "<b>Zhed</b>" wich means superior deithy,
        the soul don't exist, there is essence inside every living being, every personality and own
        characteristics are manifestations of the essence, in other words, we don't exist only the essence
        in every body.
